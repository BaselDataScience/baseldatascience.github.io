abstract: Reporting tables often have structure that goes beyond simple
    rectangular data. The 'rtables' package provides a framework for
    declaring complex multi-level tabulations and then applying them to
    data. This framework models both tabulation and the resulting tables
    as hierarchical, tree-like objects which support sibling sub-tables,
    arbitrary splitting or grouping of data in row and column dimensions,
    cells containing multiple values, and the concept of contextual
    summary computations. A convenient pipe-able interface is provided for
    declaring table layouts and the corresponding computations, and then
    applying them to data.
